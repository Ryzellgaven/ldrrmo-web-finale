- Each entry shows report type, severity, submission date/time, and current status (open, in-progress, resolved, closed)

**Incident Map**:
- Leaflet.js map with OpenStreetMap tiles
- Displays markers for nearby active incidents
- Displays evacuation center markers and flood zone overlays
- Resident's current GPS location shown on map

**Evacuation Routes and Shelter Locations**:
- List and map view of registered evacuation centers and safe zones
- Route visualization from resident's current location to nearest shelter

### 3.5 LDRRMO Responder Dashboard

Accessible to roles: LDRRMO Staff, Supervisor, Admin.

**Real-Time Incident Map**:
- Leaflet.js map with OpenStreetMap tiles
- Real-time incident markers with color-coded severity
- Responder GPS location markers use saved location updates and periodic refresh
- Evacuation center markers
- Flood zone overlays
- Clicking a marker opens incident detail panel

**Incoming Reports**:
- List of all active emergency reports with type, severity, location, reporter name, and timestamp
- Filter by status, type, and severity
- Open report detail to view full information including attached photos/videos

**Responder Assignment**:
- Assign one or more responders to an incident
- Update incident status: open, in-progress, resolved, closed
- Add status update notes
- Generate after-action report on incident closure

**Responder GPS Tracking**:
- Real-time display of all active responder GPS locations on the incident map
- Responder location updates sent from their device

**Evacuation Center Management**:
- Add, edit, and deactivate evacuation centers and safe zones
- Each center stores name, address, GPS coordinates, capacity, and current status

**IoT Flood Monitoring Dashboard**:
- Real-time charts displaying water level and rainfall data from registered IoT sensors
- Current sensor readings with timestamps
- Threshold-based alert indicators: when a sensor reading exceeds a configured threshold, an alert is triggered and displayed

**Caller/SMS Emergency Log**:
- Manual entry form: caller name, contact number, reported location (manual GPS input or address), emergency type, description
- Log is saved to the database and appears as an incident that can be assigned to a responder
- List view of all caller/SMS-logged incidents

**Notification Broadcasting**:
- Compose and send broadcast messages to all residents or a selected group
- Notification channels: in-app broadcast, push notification to PWA, SMS via configured gateway, email
- Sent notification history log

### 3.6 Administrator Panel

Accessible to role: Admin only.

**User Management**:
- View, create, edit, and deactivate user accounts (residents, responders, admins)
- Assign and change user roles
- Search and filter users by role, name, or status

**System Configuration**:
- Configure SMS gateway settings
- Configure notification thresholds and default alert messages
- Manage system-wide parameters

## 4. Business Rules and Logic

### 4.1 Role-Based Access Control

| Role | Accessible Areas |
|---|---|
| Resident | Resident Portal only |
| LDRRMO Staff | Responder Dashboard (no broadcast, no evacuation center management) |
| Supervisor | Full Responder Dashboard |
| Admin | Full Responder Dashboard + Administrator Panel |

- Protected routes are checked in the frontend, and the PHP API independently enforces the current account's role for every protected operation
- Unauthorized access attempts redirect to login

### 4.2 Incident Lifecycle

- Status flow: open -> in-progress -> resolved -> closed
- Only Supervisor and Admin can mark an incident as resolved or closed
- Closing an incident requires an after-action report entry

### 4.3 IoT Alert Triggers

- When a sensor reading exceeds the configured threshold for that device, the system automatically creates an alert notification
- Alert is displayed on the IoT dashboard and dispatched as a broadcast notification to all residents

### 4.4 Offline Queuing (Resident PWA)

- Emergency reports created without connectivity are stored in local device storage
- When connectivity is restored, queued reports are automatically submitted to the backend API

### 4.5 Real-Time Location Updates

- Residents sharing location during an active emergency send GPS coordinates to the backend at regular intervals
- Responders on active assignments send GPS coordinates to the backend at regular intervals
- Both are displayed as live markers on the incident map

### 4.6 Notification Dispatch

- Push notifications are dispatched to PWA subscribers
- SMS alerts are sent via the configured SMS gateway
- In-app broadcasts are stored in the notifications table and shown on refresh. SMS, email, and push channels require separately configured delivery providers and must not be reported as delivered otherwise.
- Email notifications are sent via the configured email service

## 5. Exceptions and Edge Cases

| Scenario | Handling |
|---|---|
| GPS unavailable on report submission | User is prompted to enter location manually; submission is not blocked |
| Offline report submission | Report queued locally; submitted automatically when online |
| Duplicate report submission | Backend checks for reports from the same user within a short time window for the same location and type; duplicate flagged for review |
| IoT sensor offline | Sensor status shown as offline on dashboard; last known reading displayed with timestamp |
| PHP session expired | User is redirected to login page |
| Unauthorized role access | Redirect to appropriate portal; action denied |
| SMS gateway failure | Notification dispatch logs the failure; in-app and push notifications still sent |

---

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

1. A new resident registers an account, logs in, and is directed to the Resident Portal.
2. The resident submits an emergency report with GPS coordinates, emergency type, severity, and an optional photo attachment.
3. The submitted report appears immediately on the LDRRMO Responder Dashboard incident map as a new marker and in the incoming reports list.
4. An LDRRMO Supervisor logs in, opens the report, assigns a responder, and updates the incident status to in-progress.
5. The resident views the updated status of their report in My Reports.
6. The Supervisor broadcasts a notification; the resident receives it as an in-app message.
7. The Supervisor marks the incident as resolved and submits an after-action report, then closes the incident.
8. An Admin logs in, views the audit log entry for the closed incident, and reviews the analytics dashboard showing the incident count.
